##  Play Around!

* If you used VS 2013, check out the bootstrap stuff that's already in the template!
 * Start with Home/Index.cshtml for the main page, and Shared/_Layout.cshtml for the navbar.
 * Resize the page, and watch the magic of responsive css!

* If you used 2012, try making some divs and adding classes like "jumbotron" or "col-md-#" where # is 1 through 12.
 * See the bootstrap [css](http://getbootstrap.com/css/) & [components](http://getbootstrap.com/components/) pages for more examples

* Turn links into [buttons](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#buttons) using class "btn btn-default" or one of its sister classes

* Everyone make sure you put in a [table](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#tables)!
 * Bootstrap-ify it by adding the class "table"
